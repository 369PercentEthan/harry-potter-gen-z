Harry Potter: The Gen Z Edition

This project provides a place for anyone to collaborate on Harry Potter: The Gen Z edition, inspired by [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/r87mvh/accidentally_bought_the_gen_z_how_do_you_do/).

_*Anyone*_ is able to contribute by suggesting changes to files, as long as you have a GitHub account. The easiest way to do so is by navigating to the file you want to edit and clicking the "Edit" button:

To suggest a change, you have to open a "Pull Request". If you make the change in only your copy of the project, it will NOT be reflected in this copy. (I went in and manually merged in some of the changes a few of you have contributed, which is why you may see your changes already reflected here!)
